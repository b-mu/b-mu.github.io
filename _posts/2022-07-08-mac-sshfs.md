0. Install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php)
	* e.g. for Montery v12, simply download the ```.pkg``` and install
1. Install [sshfs](https://ports.macports.org/port/sshfs/)
	* ```sudo port install sshfs```
2. Install [macFuse](https://osxfuse.github.io/)
	* need to allow system software from Benjamin Fleischer in System Preferences to use this extension
3. Create a directory and mount the remote file system
	* ```mkidr local_fs```
	* ```sshfs $USERNAME@HOST:DIR local_fs```
	* if the server requires key authentication, use ```sshfs $USERNAME@HOST:DIR local_fs -o IdentityFile=PATH_TO_KEY```
4. (note) If the connection is broken, the local directory that the remote system is mounted might show as busy but cannot be read or written to. One can unmount the fs by ```umount -f local_fs``` and mount at ```local_fs``` again (as in step 3)
