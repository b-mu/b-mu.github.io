I am a researcher at Vector Institute. I obtained my Honours Bachelor of Science degree with High Distinction from University of Toronto in June 2022. I completed the Computer Science Specialist program with a focus in Scientific Computing and the Statistics Minor Program. My research interests are Numerical methods and Computer Systems. My current focus is large-scale neural network training with distributed second-order methods. I previously interned (12 months) at Intel's Deep Learning Acceleration Group, during which I mostly worked on the graph compiler for FPGA.
